In this project, I have created a todo list website using Django, a popular Python web framework. The website allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, as well as to log in and out using a secure authentication system.

The main challenges I faced in this project were:

1. Designing a user-friendly and responsive interface using HTML, CSS.
2. Implementing the CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality for the tasks using Django models, views, and forms.
3. Integrating the Django authentication system to enable user registration and login/logout features.


The main features of my website are:

1. A home page that displays the current tasks of the logged-in user.
2. A create task page that allows the user to add a new task with a title, description.
3. An update task page that allows the user to edit the details of an existing task.
4. A delete task page that allows the user to remove a task from the database.
5. A login page that prompts the user to enter their username and password.
6. A logout page that logs out the user and redirects them to the login page.
7. A register page that allows the user to create a new account with a username, email, and password.
